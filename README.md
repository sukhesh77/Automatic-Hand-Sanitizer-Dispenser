# 🧴 Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser

A hardware-based project designed to promote contactless hygiene using IR sensors and servo motor controlled by Arduino Uno. This project was built during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce physical contact and increase safety in public spaces.

## 🔍 Overview

This dispenser automatically releases sanitizer when it detects a hand below the nozzle using an IR sensor. It helps minimize contact and promotes safe hygiene practices.


## 🛠️ Project Highlights

- Contactless dispensing using IR sensors
- Low-cost and easy-to-build
- Can be installed in offices, schools, hospitals
